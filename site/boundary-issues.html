            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.alba.art/projects/boundary-issues">Boundary Issues</a> is a long-form project, released June of 2023 on <a href="https://www.alba.art/">Alba</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.alba.art/exhibitions/flatlands">Flatlands group show</a>.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                The initial idea evolved from <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/13587">Divergent Convergence</a>, which at times seemed like two separate projects to me: one leaning towards order, and the other towards chaos. For this series, I wanted to continue working with intersecting geometric shapes, this time exploring cleaner lines and minimalism, favoring order. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I added the outlines intentionally, but their extension into the image margin was accidental. It worked so well that I decided to keep it, and that is what inspired the series title. Once I had the title, everything about the project suddenly fell into place: the outlines themselves; the occasionally off-balance, awkward composition, sometimes feeling overcrowded and other times lonely; the shapes extending into the margin, not respecting the bounds of the image. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The animation in this series serves to playfully highlight and enhance the underlying structure of the larger shapes, and also to give a sense of depth to this otherwise very flat construction.
            </p>


            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                Boundary Issues is made with GLSL/WebGL and vanilla JS. Creation consists of generating 3 layers of shapes differing in scale and distribution, colorizing and combining those layers, and finally applying post-processing effects.
            </p>

            <h3>Generate large shapes</h3>
            <p>
                Two or three large shapes are generated and placed precisely. The shape generation is repeated at different scales, and the results are combined in various ways.

            <h3>Generate medium shapes</h3>
            <p>
                Medium-sized shapes are generated and placed in a random radial distribution.

            <h3>Generate small shapes</h3>
            <p>
                Cell noise is generated, modified, and used to place the small shapes. There's a high chance they will be the same shape as the other layers.

            <h3>Colorize and combine</h3>
            <p>
                The large and medium shape layers are combined and colorized. The small shape layer is separately colorized, and the two are combined with alpha blending. 
            </p>

            <h3>Post-processing</h3>
            <p>
                The blended and colorized shape layers are outlined. A frame is added, and the whole pieces is textured with multi-resolution cell noise.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                This series needed a lot of iteration before it began to 'feel' right. It's a rather backwards way of working, feeling your way to the vision. I tend to begin a project with abstract ideas or concepts I begin to explore, or I use a tool like <a href="https://noisedeck.app">Noisedeck</a> to randomize basic building blocks and ways of combining them. 
                I rely heavily on my intuition to know when I'm onto something good and to guide a project towards completion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The intuitive challenge of this project was finding and staying true to its unique voice. What was I really trying to say? How did the elements of design support it? Had it veered off into excessive minimalism or noise? There were many branches that were not-quite-right and were ultimately discarded (some pictured below). The whole creative process took almost a year. But it was all worth it, and I'm proud of the result.
