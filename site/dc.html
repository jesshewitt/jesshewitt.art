            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/13587">Divergent Convergence</a> is a long-form project for <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/">fxhash</a>, born from experiments with Perlin noise, domain distortion, and simple SDF shapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The essence of this series is combining shapes and noise in interesting ways - balancing opposites.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                My workflow has been typically shader-based, but I recently purchased a pen plotter and needed a source of randomness to use for generating SVG with Javascript. I decided to implement Perlin noise from scratch, just for fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, after I implemented it in Javascript, I had to port it to GLSL so I could also use it with shaders. I had so much fun using the noise in shaders that I have barely touched the plotter. (Sorry, friend!)
            </p>
            <p>
                I was curious about how far you could push simple concepts like Perlin noise and signed distance fields/functions to create visually compelling compositions. I also wanted to play around with the idea of order and chaos, especially the boundaries between the two.
                Divergent Convergence was inspired by this experimentation.
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            
            <p>
                The concept and process of this series is fairly simple - shapes and noise are combined and post-processed with a palette, frame and texture.
            </p>

            <h3>Domain distortion</h3>
            <p>
                Perlin noise is used to distort a set of coordinates. The scale and intensity of this distortion is randomized.
            </p>

            <h3>Perlin noise</h3>
            <p>
                Perlin noise is generated again, this time using the warped coordinates and a randomized scale.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Shapes</h3>
            <p>
                Three shapes are generated. The type, scale, and position of each shape are randomized.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Combining</h3>
            <p>
                The shapes are combined using random methods. The combined shapes are then mixed with Perlin noise, and again the mixing method is randomized.
            </p>

            <h3>Finishing</h3>
            <p>
                The combined shapes and noise are colorized using a random palette. A frame and subtle texture are added.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I loved creating Divergent Convergence! I spent about two months working on it, and about half of that time was spent fine-tuning the output. It was a labor of love - I wanted it to be as close to perfect as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real challenge of this series was to produce reliably good pieces of sufficient variety. Some interesting variations and palettes did not make it into the final version 
                because I was unable to achieve quality results with them 100% of the time.
